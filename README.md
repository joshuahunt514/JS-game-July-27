- July 26th, taking a break from the Practice Site to try making a game!

- First, make root directory and sub-directories
- Second, Gitbash the new root directory and git touch to make README.md, index.html, style.css and script.js
- Third, open folder in VS Code, and away we go!

- Guide for the game is here:

- I made my first animation (and understood how I made it and how it worked!)

- It's actually working out pretty nicely!
    - Ball is bouncing off the walls properly
